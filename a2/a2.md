# Logical Data Model

> "Create the appropriate *relations* to represent the *entities* and *relationships* of the E-R diagram."

## Strong Entities

- **Account** (__ssn__, gender, phoneNumber, email, dateOfBirth)
- **Product** (__id__, time)
- **Organization** (__name__, address)
- **VirtualMachine** (__id__, capability)

## Weak Entities

- **DeveloperAccount** (officeAddress)
- **CustomerAccount** (creditCard, homeAddress)
- **Music** (type, quality)
- **Book** (author, title)
- **Video** (title, rank)
- **Image** (size, category)

## Relationships

- **DeveloperAccount** (0..\*) *Affiliated_to* (1..1) **Organization** (Optional Many-to-One)
- **CustomerAccount** (0..1) *Owns* (1..\*) **VirtualMachine** (Optional One-to-Many)
- **Organization** (1..1) *Maintains* (0..\*) **VirtualMachine** (One-to-Many)
- **Product** (0..\*) *Runs_on* (0..\*) **VirtualMachine** (Many-to-Many)
- **DeveloperAccount** (1..\*) *Develops* (0..\*) **Product** (Many-to-Many)
- **CustomerAccount** (0..\*) *Buys* (0..\*) **Product** (Many-to-Many)

### One-to-Many (1:\*) binary relationship types

"we post a copy of the primary key of the parent entity into the relation representing the child entity, to act as a foreign key" [@TConnollyBegg2015, p.531].

Organization (parent) -> Developer (child)

- **Developer** ( officeAddress, *dev_org*) : Foreign Key `dev_org` references Organization( __name__ )

CustomerAccount (parent) -> VirtualMachine (child)

- **VirtualMachine** ( __id__, capability, *owner* ) : Foreign Key `owner` references Account( __id__ )

Organization (parent) -> VirtualMachine(child)

- **VirtualMachine** ( __id__, capability, *owner*, *mac_org*) : Foreign Key `mac_org` references Organization(__name__)

"in the case where a 1:\* relationship has one or more attributes, these attributes should follow the posting of the primary key to the child relation" [@TConnollyBegg2015, p. 531]

CustomerAccount (parent) -> VirtualMachine (child)

- **VirtualMachine** ( __id__, capability, *owner*, date )


### Many-to-Many (\*:\*) Relationships

> "For each \*:\* binary relationship, create a relation to represent the relationship and include any attributes that are part of the relationship. We post a copy of the primary key attribute(s) of the entities that participate in the relationship into the new relation, to act as foreign keys. One or both of these foreign keys will also form the primary key of the new relation..." [@TConnollyBegg2015, p.535]

- Product *Runs_on* VirtualMachine ---> create **MachineUsage** ( __product_id__, __mac_id__, product_type )
- DeveloperAccount *Develops* Product ---> create **ProductDevelopment** ( __dev_ssn__, __product_id__, product_type )

	- Since these two reference `product_id`, ie. the *foreign key* referencing Product(id), but as we will combine the `Product` entity with its disjoint subtypes following Connolly & Begg's instruction referenced below, I have also included `product_type` so that it is not necessary to search through all the product subtype tables to find the required `product_id`.
	- `mac_id` references VirtualMachine( id )
	- `dev_ssn` references Account( id )

- CustomerAccount *Buys* Product ---> create **Purchase** ( __customer_ssn__, __mac_id__, price, discount )

	- `customer_ssn` references Account( id )
	- `mac_id` references VirtualMachine( id )

## Combine Superclass/Subclass Relationships

- DeveloperAccount, CustomerAccount *{mandatory, and}* Account
- Music, Book, Video, Image {mandatory, or} Product

For *{mandatory, and}*: "Single relation (with one or more discriminators to distinguish the type of each tuple" [@TConnollyBegg2015, p.534]

- **Account** (__ssn__, gender, phoneNumber, email, dateOfBirth, officeAddress, *dev_org*, creditCard, homeAddress, devFlag, customerFlag)

For *{mandatory, or}*: "Many relations; one relation for each combined superclass/subclass" [@TConnollyBegg2015, p.534]

- **Music** (__id__, time, type, quality)
- **Book** (__id__, time, author, title)
- **Video** (__id__, time, title, rank)
- **Image** (__id__, time, size, category)

## Final Relations

> "Designate the *primary key*, and any *alternate* or *foreign* keys of each relation together with their references."

Attributes that form part of the primary key is __bold__ -- if two attributes are bold they are both necessary to make up the PK.  
Foreign keys are shown in *italic* with reference explained underneath.

- **Account** (__ssn__, gender, phoneNumber, email, dateOfBirth, officeAddress, *dev_org*, creditCard, homeAddress, devFlag, customerFlag)
	- Foreign Key `dev_org` references Organization(name)

- **Organization** (__name__, address)

- **VirtualMachine** (__mac_id__, capability, *owner*, date)
	- Foreign Key `owner` references Account(ssn)
	- Primary Key `mac_id` renamed to distinguish from `product_id`

- **Music** (__product_id__, time, type, quality)
	- Primary Key `product_id` renamed to distinguish from `mac_id` (and below)

- **Book** (__product_id__, time, author, title)

- **Video** (__product_id__, time, title, rank)

- **Image** (__product_id__, time, size, category)

- **MachineUsage** (*__product_id__*, *__mac_id__*, product_type)
	- Foreign Key `product_id` references Product(product_id) found in table given by `product_type`
	- Foreign Key `mac_id` references VirtualMachine(mac_id)
	- Primary key (product_id, mac_id)

- **ProductDevelopment**(*__dev_ssn__*, *__product_id__*, product_type)
	- Foreign Key `product_id` references Product(product_id) found in table given by `product_type`
	- Foreign Key `dev_ssn` references Account(ssn)
	- Primary key(dev_ssn, product_id)

- **Purchase**(*__customer_ssn__*, *__mac_id__*, price, discount)
	- Foreign Key `customer_ssn` references Account(ssn)
	- Foreign Key `mac_id` references VirtualMachine(mac_id)


# Normalization

> Decompose the `ConferenceData` table into relations which are in 3rd normal form.

```
ConferenceData(participantID, participantName, participantAddress,
		sessionLocation, sessionDate, sessionStartTime, sessionDuration,
		topicID, topicName, paperID, paperTitle, SPCID, SPCName)
```

## Identifying Primary Key Using Functional Dependencies

1. participantID *functionally determines* participantName, participantAddress
2. paperID *functionally determines* paperTitle, SPCID, SPCName, topicID, topicName, sessionLocation, sessionDate, sessionStartTime, sessionDuration
3. topicID *functionally determines* topicName
4. topicName *functionally determines* topicID
5. SPCID *functionally determines* SPCName
6. sessionDate, topicID *functionally determines* sessionLocation, sessionStartingTime
7. sessionLocation, sessionDate, sessionStartingTime *functionally determines* topicID, topicName

Primary Key: participantID, paperID, sessionDate, topicID

## First Normal Form

> "A relation in which the intersection of each row and column contains one and only one value" [@TConnollyBegg2015, p.466]

Participants can attend multiple sessions (provided no clash) so attributes related to session (`sessionLocation`, `sessionDate`, `sessionStartTime`, `sessionDuration`, `topicID`, `topicName`) may have multiple values for given participant.

Sessions last up to 2 hours; papers last 20 min, plus 5 min for questions. So up to four papers per session.

Assignment says to assume table is flattened, so multiple values recorded through repeating data on multiple rows. Therefore table is in First Normal Form.

## Second Normal Form

> "A relation that is in first normal form and every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key" [@TConnollyBegg2015, p.470]

1. Participant(__participantID__, participantName, participantAddress)
2. Paper(__paperID__, paperTitle, SPCID, SPCName, topicID, topicName, sessionLocation, sessionDate, sessionStartTime, sessionDuration)
3. Topic(__topicID__, topicName)
4. SPC(__SPCID__, SPCName)
5. Session(__sessionDate__, __topicID__, sessionLocaton, sessionStartingTime)


## Third Normal Form

> "A relation that is in first and second normal form and in which no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key". [@TConnollyBegg2015, p.472]

Transitive Dependencies:

- (2) \+ (3) : paperID --> topicID --> topicName
- (2) \+ (4) : paperID --> SPCID --> SPCName
- (2) \+ (5) : paperID --> sessionDate, topicID --> sessionLocation, sessionDuration, sessionStartTime

Finalized Entities in 3rd Normal Form:

1. Participant(__participantID__, participantName, participantAddress)
2. Paper(__paperID__, paperTitle, topicID, sessionDate, SPCID)
3. Session(__sessionDate__, __topicID__, sessionStartingTime, sessionLocation, sessionDuration)
4. Topic(__topicID__, topicName)
5. SPC(__SPCID__, SPCName)
